    <h2>Testing Details</h2>
    <p>The site is responsive, so in order to test that, you will have to resize the browser</p>
    <h2>References</h2>
    <p>Almost all the code is written by us, some reference was taken from w3schools.com while making the site for the usage of tags, attributes and such stuff.</p>
    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong> Got to learn from our mistakes.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> other team members left, would have been more fun to work with them also.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> coding the website was fun and it helped us increasing our coding skills and gain some confidence in coding. Can now add web desiging as a skill on our resumes. </p>
